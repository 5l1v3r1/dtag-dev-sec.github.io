We truely believe in the power of a strong community.
Last year, some of us joined [The Honeynet Project](http://honeynet.org) where we found shelter at the [Sysenter Chapter](http://www.sysenter-honeynet.org/). Some of us will attend this year's [Honeynet Workshop](http://stavanger2015.honeynet.org) in Stavanger, Norway.

We are really looking forward to the technical discussions and the exchange of opinions and experience.
