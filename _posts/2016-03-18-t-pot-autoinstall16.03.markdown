We fully understand that you want to check out the brand new features of [T-Pot 16.03](http://dtag-dev-sec.github.io/mediator/feature/2016/03/11/t-pot-16.03.html). 

For those, who are unable to [install from an ISO image](http://dtag-dev-sec.github.io/mediator/feature/2016/03/11/t-pot-16.03.html#prebuilt), as your system is living in a rackspace somewhere on the other side of the globe, we have updated our [script](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/t-pot-autoinstall) that converts your Ubuntu 14.04. base install into a full-fledged [T-Pot 16.03](http://dtag-dev-sec.github.io/mediator/feature/2016/03/11/t-pot-16.03.html) within just a couple of minutes.

Just check out the script from the [repository](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/t-pot-autoinstall)  and run it. 

Have fun!
